Repository of instructions and examples for improving the reproducibility and ease of sharing of our analyses. I'll try to add more to this repository over time, but hopefully it provides a useful resource

I gave a 100mph talk on git and github, a walkthrough of what I said/meant is in the file 'git_and_github.md'.
